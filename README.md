# Next.js + Builder.io Personalization Starter

This example walks you through [personalizing statically generated landing pages with Builder.io and Next.js.](https://www.builder.io/blog/fast-personalization-nextjs-edge-middleware-builder)

## Quick start
Watch here as we go through deploying this to vercel and creating personalized content with Builder.io
https://www.loom.com/share/9706fe2c5c1e496c861f1ba9b6ac829c

## Prerequisites

Before using this example, make sure you have the following:

* A [Builder.io](builder.io) account. Check out the [plans](https://www.builder.io/m/pricing), which range from our free tier to custom.
* Save private key / public key from your space in 
## Overview

To use this project, you need to  do three things:

1. Get a copy of this repo. 
1. Create a corresponding space in your account on [Builder.io](builder.io).
1. Connect the two using the space's private and public keys.

### Generating your Builder.io space

If you've just created your Builder.io account and logged in for the first time, Builder prompts you to create a space with a new Builder site or add Builder to an existing application. 
For this example, click **Add Builder to an existing site or app**.

    <figcaption style="text-align: center">You can choose to create a new Builder site or Add Builder to an existing application.</figcaption>
</figure>

**If you don't have the introductory prompt for creating a space, take the following steps. If you do have the prompt in the previous step, skip to step 4.**

1. Click on the Organization icon on the bottom left.

      <figcaption style="text-align: center">The Organization icon features two figures and is on the left sidebar at the bottom.</figcaption>
    </figure>

1. Hover over **Builder.io** and choose **+ New Space**.

      <img src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F32d67ac4249c40fda0486fb7f38ac71b" alt="Menu options for creating a new space" width="400" style="display: block; margin: auto"/>
      <figcaption style="text-align: center">Access the menu for creating a new space by clicking on the Organization icon.</figcaption>
    </figure>

1. Click **Add Builder to an existing site or app**.

1. When Builder asks you which e-commerce platform you use, select **None**.

1. Name your new space by entering "My Next.js App" and click **Create**.

<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F3b434d77529f4ae392a3d481a926092d" alt="Dialogue for creating a new space" width="400" style="display: block; margin: auto"/>
    <figcaption style="text-align: center">Enter a name for your new space, such as "My Next.js App".</figcaption>
</figure>

Now that you have a new space, the next step is connecting this space with your next.js application.

### Connecting Builder.io to your application

To connect your Builder.io space and your application, set the site URL and get the API key as follows:

1. In Builder.io, click on the Account icon on the left sidenav.

    <figure>
       <img src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Fd26eb45cd52a4cada42413cd5c99419d" alt="Account icon in left sidenav" width="200" style="display: block; margin: auto"/>
       <figcaption style="text-align: center">The Account icon takes you to important data about this space.</figcaption>
    </figure>

1. Change the Site URL to `http://localhost:3000` and click to copy the Public API Key.

    <figure>
       <img src="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2Faec18bf8ccf543ab94c4230a7791c894" alt="Change the Site URL in account settings." width="400" style="display: block; margin: auto"/>
       <figcaption style="text-align: center">The Site URL and API Key are in the **Space** tab.</figcaption>
    </figure>

1. In your code editor, configure `.env.production` and `.env.development` with the [Public API Key](https://builder.io/account/space) by adding a line to each file as follows, but using your Public API Key that you copied in the previous step. 
    For example:

    ```shell
    BUILDER_PUBLIC_KEY=08837cee608a405c806a3bed69acfe2d <-- replace this with your API Key
    ```

Do the same for your private key

    ```shell
    BUILDER_PRIVATE_KEY=xxx-xxxxx <-- replace this with your private API Key
    ```


## Running your application

To serve your application locally, install dependencies, serve, and view your preview. 

1. Install dependencies by entering the follw\owing at the command line. 

    ```
    npm install
    ```

1. Serve your application by running the following at the command line:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

1. In your browser, go to `http://localhost:3000` to see your application.

### Experimenting

Now that you have a configured Builder.io space and a running application, start by creating a page, assign any URL, publish and preview.
For more detail and ideas on creating pages, see [Creating a landing page in Builder
](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/creating-a-landing-page).

*[Create custom targeting attributes](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/guides/targeting-and-scheduling#custom-targeting), those targeting attributes can be used when creating new content specific for a target audience.
